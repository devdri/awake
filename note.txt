TODO:
- speedup database.
	sqlite transactions?
	drop sqlite, use pickle?
- non-continuous procs: exist and make sense.
	pro:
		less small procedures - manageable graph
		flow control more visible
		more optimizations possible
	con:
		must keep each byte's ownership
		discovering new procs requires recalculating old ownership (or does it? just take over bytes, a full control subtree is moved)
- refactor operator optimizations
	optimizations separate from substituting regs
	heavier usage of masks, move limiting operations (and, shift) higher
- better context deduction: from conditions
- new context propagation algorithm, two options:
	1) use just registers
		pro:
			simple, just few variables to look at
		con:
			in some cases (stack) more vars needed to keep accurate context
	2) produce new variables
		pro:
			all possible info is saved
		con:
			hard to not produce junk
- better bad-op handling:
	display page anyway
- handle elseif chains
- better jumptable size heuristics






dfs:
- start point
- limit (next proc addr) any jump beyond that is a tailcall/etc.
- calls could probably move the limit backwards
- dfs everything within limit. could still be large.
- jump tables are expanded last (separate queue)
- isLocalAddr(addr)
- detect conflicts with jumptable space... and also overlapping instructions etc. report that
- return: set of reachable addresses within limit, jump table sizes

next pass:
- set limit to first gap.
- compute label set
- remember jump table sizes (or just use next label...)
- now disassembly possible

graph construction:
- make ordered list of basic blocks (started by labels or entry point)
- make dict: addr -> block_id
- add basic blocks, removing jump instructions
	- replace with mapping: block_id -> ordered list of exits
	- for far jumps add pseudo blocks (or replace with tail-call)
		- possibility: merge same tail calls into one block...
- return: list of basic blocks, dict of jumps between them

early optimization:
- traverse graph, optimize with context.
